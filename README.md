# first_attempt_machine_learning_predicting_upsets
This project was my first attempt at using (basic) machine learning to predict upsets in EPL matches.


Used a couple of different models including Linear Regression, K-nearest neighbors and Logistic regression.

Was this the best/most accurate way to do it? No, but it was cool to play around with different models and graph some stuff out.
